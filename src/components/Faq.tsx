      question: "What makes MMT's printing technology different from conventional digital printing?",
      answer: "At MMT, we do not simply print graphics—we engineer visual experiences. Unlike standard digital printers that use transient solvent or UV inks on standard vinyl, MMT utilizes custom Robotic Paint Drum Printers to apply premium acrylic paint formulations directly onto high-tension PVC substrates. This creates a highly saturated, chemically inert, and weatherproof color layer that retains its brilliance far longer than conventional alternatives."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the outdoor durability of MMT's large-format displays?",
      answer: "Our displays are engineered specifically to withstand the demanding climate of the GCC and MENA region. MMT's proprietary Acrylic Paint Technology provides outstanding resistance against intense UV radiation, high temperatures, humidity, and dust. We offer an industry-leading up to 4 Years Fade Resistance Warranty, during which our graphics maintain at least 95% of their original color brilliance and depth."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Double-Sided Backlit Printing Technology work?",
      answer: "Conventional single-sided backlit billboards often appear washed out or dull once internal illumination is activated. MMT's proprietary Double-Sided Backlit Printing Technology prints the identical image on both the front and reverse sides of a semi-translucent coated substrate, using computer-aligned registration. When illuminated at night, both layers work in perfect harmony to reproduce identical color intensity, deep blacks, and remarkable visual contrast, ensuring your campaign remains vibrant 24 hours a day."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Radio Frequency (RF) Welding, and why is it used?",
      answer: "Large-format displays often require multiple substrate panels to be joined together. Standard heat welding or adhesive taping can create weak joints and visible dark lines that disrupt the graphic. MMT uses advanced Radio Frequency (RF) Welding, which passes high-frequency electromagnetic energy through the overlapping vinyl. This excites the molecules and fuses the layers together at a molecular level, creating a seam that is virtually invisible and stronger than the parent material itself."
    },
    {
      question: "Can MMT handle customized dimensions for unique installations?",
      answer: "Yes. Our robotic printing systems and advanced finishing departments are fully optimized to handle custom dimensions, oversized projects, and complex shapes. We can manufacture seamless graphics in sizes up to 7 metres × 14 metres or 18 metres in a single production cycle, and join panels using RF welding to cover skyscrapers, airport terminals, shopping mall facades, and landmark city hoardings of any scale."
